The major changes which were required were:
1. Initialisation of first row and first column of the matrix(in local should be filled with zeros)
2. filling of matrix:
	-The matrix cannot have negative values
	-while filling if we get minimum value as negative we fill 0 instead of it
3. Starting position in the matrix when we start the alignment(should be max value in local alignment)
4. while aligning we end the process when we get a 0
